# Project Name: Audio Cloud Platform
This project aims to develop a website named “AudioCloud” to store and share a collection of audio files of different formats. This website will serve as a web-based platform for sharing audio files. The website will allow the registered users to upload and share the audio files. The users of the website will be able to play audio files through the embedded Audio player of the website. The user’s registration as well as the posts (audio files) for publishing will be approved by the Administrator of the website. There will be two options to share the audio files on the website: 
1.	Public (to be shared with all types of website users)
2.	Private (to be uploaded only for registered user’s personal use)
   
The registered user will be able to upload the audio in different categories such as Quran Recitations, Naats, Audio Lectures, Audio Notes, Sound Effects, Royalty music etc. There will be a proper interface(s) for registered users to manage their posts (audio files). The administrator of the website will have a proper Admin Panel through which he/she will be able to manage the whole website (approving or rejecting user registration requests, approving/rejecting posts, adding/deleting audio categories, searching uploaded audio files by different keywords and filters, uploading and deleting any audio file, etc.). There will be the proper audio player to run/play the audio files. There must be user-friendly interfaces and effective navigation schemes on the website.
